## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to train and assess a model for predicting loan risk. The dataset used in this project contains information related to loans, specifically including the status of each loan (whether it is a healthy loan or a high-risk loan). It consists of historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending platform. It includes variables such as loan amount, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status.
The stages of the machine learning process I went through were loading, processing and splitting data as well as model training and Model evaluation. 

The methods used were Logisitic Regression and Evaluation Metrics (Confusion Matrix). 


## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
