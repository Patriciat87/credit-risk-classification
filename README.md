## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to train and assess a model for predicting loan risk. The dataset used in this project contains information related to loans, specifically including the status of each loan (whether it is a healthy loan or a high-risk loan). It consists of historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending platform. It includes variables such as loan amount, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status.
The stages of the machine learning process I went through were loading, processing and splitting data as well as model training and Model evaluation. 

The methods used were Logisitic Regression and Evaluation Metrics (Confusion Matrix).
